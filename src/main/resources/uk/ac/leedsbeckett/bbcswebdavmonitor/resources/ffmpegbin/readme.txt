ffmpeg is not distributed with this building block because of its licensing.

It is up to you to examine the licensing, decide if you are allowed to make
use of ffmpeg and if so, upload the executable into this folder.

Note that all the functionality you require must be statically linked into
a single executable file named 'ffmpeg'.
